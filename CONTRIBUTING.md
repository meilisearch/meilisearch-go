# Contributing <!-- omit in TOC -->

First of all, thank you for contributing to Meilisearch! The goal of this document is to provide everything you need to know in order to contribute to Meilisearch and its different integrations.

- [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
- [Development Workflow](#development-workflow)
- [Git Guidelines](#git-guidelines)
- [Release Process (for internal team only)](#release-process-for-internal-team-only)

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)(PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Meilisearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [Meilisearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-go/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-go/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the meilisearch-go repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-go repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-go/releases/).

## Development Workflow

### Setup <!-- omit in TOC -->

You can set up your local environment natively or using `docker`, check out the [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml).

Example of running all the checks with docker:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm package bash -c "go get && golangci-lint run -v && go test -v"
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
go get -v -t -d ./...
```

### Tests and Linter <!-- omit in TOC -->

Each PR should pass the tests and the linter to be accepted.

```bash
# Tests
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh # download Meilisearch
./meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics # run Meilisearch
go clean -cache ; go test -v ./...
# Use golangci-lint
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app golangci/golangci-lint:v1.42.0 golangci-lint run -v
# Use gofmt
gofmt -w ./..
```

### EasyJson <!-- omit in TOC -->

[`easyjson`](https://github.com/mailru/easyjson) is a package used for optimizing marshal/unmarshal Go structs to/from JSON. It takes the `types.go` file as an input, and auto-generates `types_easyjson.go` with optimized marshalling and unmarshalling methods for this SDK.

If for any reason `types.go` is modified, this file should be regenerated by running easyjson again.

#### Install easyjson <!-- omit in TOC -->

```bash
# for Go < 1.17
go get -u github.com/mailru/easyjson/...
```
#### or
```bash
# for Go >= 1.17
go get github.com/mailru/easyjson && go install github.com/mailru/easyjson/...@latest
```

#### Regenerate `types_easyjson.go` <!-- omit in TOC -->

```bash
easyjson -all types.go
```

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in TOC -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in TOC -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in TOC -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-go/releases/).

## Release Process (for the internal team only)

Meilisearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

### Automated Changelogs <!-- omit in TOC -->

This project integrates a tool to create automated changelogs.<br>
_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/release-drafter.md)._

### How to Publish the Release <!-- omit in TOC -->

⚠️ Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md).

Make a PR updating the version with the new one on this file:
- [`version.go`](/version.go):
  ```go
    const VERSION = "X.X.X"
  ```

Once the changes are merged on `main`, you can publish the current draft release via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-go/releases): on this page, click on `Edit` (related to the draft release) > update the description (be sure you apply [these recommendations](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md#writting-the-release-description)) > when you are ready, click on `Publish release`.
