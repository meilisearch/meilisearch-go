# Task Management Example

This example shows how to monitor and manage Meilisearch tasks.

## What it does

1. Create an index (generates a task)
2. Add documents (generates a task)  
3. Update settings (generates a task)
4. Wait for tasks to complete
5. Get individual task details
6. List all tasks with filters
7. Filter tasks by type (document operations only)

## Task information shown

For each task you see:
- Task ID and type
- Status (enqueued, processing, succeeded, failed)
- Start and finish times
- Duration
- Error details if it failed

## Configuration

```bash
export MEILI_HOST="http://localhost:7700"
export MEILI_API_KEY="your-admin-api-key"
```

Note: You need an admin API key (not a search key) to manage tasks.
